Elliot "solitaryDoomsday" Pines is a young, trans digital artist from Austin, currently based in [REDACTED]. He is known for his strange visuals, bright colors and weird characters that he posts to his various social medias, usually fanart of media popular on Tumblr in the early 2010s.

He started drawing when he was very young and has been drawing for his entire life, but started to turn it into a serious dream when he was a kid. He has been working to make his dreams a reality for the past 6 years. A lot of his work is fan-related, but he is currently working on developing several comic ideas, such as multiple original works and a Homestuck fan comic.
